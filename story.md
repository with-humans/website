We, that is [Raimo, Chris and Benjamin](/humans), first met each other at a conference.
[SoCraTes](https://www.socrates-conference.de/) to be exact. We learned from and about each other and kept in touch
through our involvement in the software crafting community and latest by meeting again at the yearly SoCraTes.

Soon enough, we got the chance to work together on a project, and we took it. It was there that we found out that we not only
enjoyed working together and that we worked together well, but most importantly that we also had similar views on the people-side of how tech products should be built.

Fundamentally, it was clear to us, that people should *always* be front and center and all our endeavors and the practices we employ and teach should all contribute to that end.

After going our own ways for some time, we got back together in 2018 and schemed how our ideal workplace could look like and how the three of us could start making this a reality. We wanted to show the world that pairing technical excellence with a human-centric organisation that will always put its workers first can make a difference for the better. This is what became [with humans' vision](/vision).
