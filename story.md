We, that is [Raimo, Chris and Benjamin](/humans), first met each other at a conference. SoCraTes to be exact. We learned
from each other and learned about each other, kept in touch through our involvement in the software crafting community
and latest by meeting again at the yearly SoCraTes.

When we later had the chance to work together on a project, we took it. It was there that we found out, we not only
enjoyed working together, and that we worked together well, but that we shared not only lots of values around technical
topics, but that we also had similar views on the people-side of how tech products should be built.

Fundamentally, it was clear to us, that people should *always* be front and center, when working together.

So, after each going their own ways, we got together again in 2018.

We shared the desire to work as a team again, and we shared the idea to show the world and teams around the world, that
putting people first, and pairing a human-centric organisation with technical excellence, will make a difference for the
better in people's lives.  
Fundamentally, we shared what became [with humans' vision](/vision).
