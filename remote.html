            To us, remote means lifting your company's culture to the next
            level, away from dedicated "home-office" days to a point where every
            team member can make the call on where they will be
            <strong>most effective</strong> on any day themselves.

            In very practical short workshops, we uncover your team's biggest
            pain points with remote and work with them towards solving them. The
            sessions include materials that your team can refer to in the future
            and a written write-up for your leadership team with practical
            advise on how to further strenghten the team's remote skills.

            is built on. However, building great relationships when working as a
            remote team, can be challenging and needs new practices.
