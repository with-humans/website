## How working with us looks like

Our industry has seen a plethora of collaboration models, engineering practices and values despite its relative young age.

We've seen good times and we've seen bad times. Whenever we felt the team we worked with succeeded in their endeavors, we took note of their practices and values so we can bring them to our next project.

**Before we start a new project**, we are eager to meet the team we're working with. **Team**, for us, includes everyone who's involved in the project, from developers to designers, from product owners to QA engineers.

If you're an agency and we're working on a customer project of yours together, we insist on a direct and fast channel to that customer. We love feedback from end-customers, so bring them as close to us as possible.
