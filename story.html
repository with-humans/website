<p>
  We, that is Raimo, Chris and Benjamin, first met each other at a conference. SoCraTes to be exact.
  We learned from each other and learned about each other, kept in touch through our involvement in
  the software crafting community and latest by meeting again at the yearly SoCraTes.

  When we later had the chance to work together on a project, we took it. It was there that we found
  out, we not only enjoyed working together, and that we worked together well, but that we shared
  not only lots of values around technical topics, but that we also had similar views on the
  people-side of how tech products should be built.
</p>


<p>
  Fundamentally, it was clear to us, that people should <strong>always</strong> be front and center,
  when working together.
</p>

<p>
  So, after each going their own ways, we got together again in 2018. We shared the desire to work
  as a team again, and shared the idea to show the world and teams around the world, that putting
  people first, and pairing a human-centric organisation with technical excellence, will make a
  difference for the better in people's lives.
